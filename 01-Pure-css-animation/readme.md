Welcome to the Pure CSS Animation Project! This project demonstrates how to create interactive, animated UI components using only HTML and CSSâ€”no JavaScript required. The primary example in this repository is an interactive card that flips to reveal additional content, showcasing the power of CSS transitions, keyframe animations, and 3D transforms.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to illustrate how advanced animations and transitions can be implemented using only HTML and CSS. The interactive card component:
- Uses **CSS transitions** for smooth scaling and shadow effects.
- Implements **CSS keyframe animations** for a flipping effect.
- Leverages **3D transforms** with `perspective` and `transform-style` to create a realistic flip.
- Demonstrates responsive design practices ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

This repository serves as both an educational resource and a starting point for developers who want to add dynamic, visually engaging elements to their websites without relying on JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Card Animation**: A card that flips on hover, revealing back-side content.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Transitions applied to scaling and box-shadow properties for a dynamic hover effect.
- **3D Effects**: Utilizes CSS 3D transforms to create a realistic flip animation.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts the layout for various screen sizes using media queries.
- **Clean and Modular CSS**: Well-commented and organized CSS for easy customization and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup to structure the content.
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling including transitions, animations, and transforms.
- **CSS Flexbox & Grid (Optional)**: For layout management and responsive design.
